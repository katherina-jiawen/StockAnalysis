# StockAnalysis
Aim to test the validity of a saying in the stock market —  ‘You will earn money when you buy the stocks that price is above the moving average and sell them when the price is under’. 
Predict the yield rate of stocks under three situations when trading stocks: the first one was long-term yield rate (holding it without transactions
), the second was the yield rate when people buy the stock at the price above MA and sell below it, and the third was the advanced version of the second. People shorted the stocks when price below MA. 
In this program, you are able to pick the stock, define the time length and choose the moving average.
